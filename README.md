# GEOVIS

Codebase for learning how to display geolocations and connections between them in an Openframeworks iOS app.

In its current form the app displays a visualization for the global flight network, showing all major airports, the connections sorted by number of connections. Future development plans include making this app so users can upload custom data and interact with it more than in v0.1.0.

This iOS app is currently for local testing only and has not been submitted to the App Store.
