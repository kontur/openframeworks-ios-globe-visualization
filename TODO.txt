General planning and TODO file for the Globe Visualization project


Tasks:

* render a globe (DONE)
    * texture mapping (DONE)

* touch interaction (DONE)
    * touch rotate (DONE)
    * pinch zoom (DONE)
    * add interface: (DONE)
        * viewport reset button (not needed)
        * init screen (DONE)
        * (maybe) UIKit slider for # connections / connection tension (DONE)

* drawing connection arcs
    * data for connections (DONE)
        * read in json (currently implemented as packaged csv file)
    * mapping from geolocation to sphere coordinated (DONE)

Improvements:
* touch rotate behaves unnatural; y axis rotate inverts on the backside of the sphere... (DONE)
* connections are drawn even behind the globe / globe not "solid" (DONE)
