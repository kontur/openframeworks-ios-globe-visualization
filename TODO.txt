General planning and TODO file for the Globe Visualization project


Tasks:

* render a globe
    * texture mapping

* touch interaction
    * touch rotate
    * pinch zoom
    * add interface:
        * viewport reset button
        * init screen
        * (maybe) UIKit slider for # connections / connection tension

* drawing connection arcs
    * data for connections
        * read in json
    * mapping from geolocation to sphere coordinated

Improvements:
* touch rotate behaves unnatural; y axis rotate inverts on the backside of the sphere...
* connections are drawn even behind the globe / globe not "solid"
